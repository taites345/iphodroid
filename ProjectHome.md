A few people on my website asking me how to install the Android OS into their iPhone devices. That question still hard to answer and unsafe to ensure.

Dispite all the labs and developments of this Project, everything still running unfinished. So I decided to give you a little taste throughout my application which now supports Install and Uninstall process.

This software transfers all the files necessary to run Android on your iPhone and keeps your device on SAFE with your iPhone Operating System running and working on fine.


Also, you can play around inside the Utility section which allows you to change files from different dev communities. So, feel free to contact me and ask me anything regarding IPHODROID and of course I accept suggestion and contributions.
